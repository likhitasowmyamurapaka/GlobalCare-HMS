    <h2>Nephrology</h2>

    <p>
        Nephrology is a medical specialty focused on diagnosing and treating kidney disorders. 
        Kidneys play a vital role in filtering waste, balancing fluids, and maintaining overall body chemical 
        stability. Ignoring kidney-related symptoms may lead to severe outcomes including kidney failure, 
        high blood pressure, and electrolyte imbalance. A specialist in this field, known as a Nephrologist, 
        manages diseases affecting kidney function and related systemic conditions.

    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
