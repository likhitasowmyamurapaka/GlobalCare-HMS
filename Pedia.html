        Pediatrics is a medical specialty focusing on the healthcare of newborns, children, and

        the child’s growth and long-term well-being. A Pediatrician specializes in diagnosing, 
        preventing, and managing childhood diseases, infections, nutritional disorders, developmental 
        issues, and behavioral conditions.

    <h2>Symptoms</h2>

        Symptoms in children vary depending on age, health condition, and infection type. Infants often 
        show different signs compared to older children. Parents should observe symptoms closely as 
        children may not always express what they feel.
